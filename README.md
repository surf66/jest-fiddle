# Jest Fiddle
I created this project to experiment with Jest. Previously I have only tested React applications using Karma and Jasmine.

The project contains examples of the following:

- React component snapshot tests
- Tests covering React component callback functions
- Tests covering async functionality
- Tests covering React component lifecycle methods
